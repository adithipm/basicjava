Here are my 13 session notes:

Methods are actions. In a method, first you have to put the name, then put the inputs and what the method gives back.

Method syntax:

outputDataType methodName(input){
    return returnValue;
}

If you just write a print statement in the class, it won't print because you haven't used it. For it to print, it needs to be called in the application class.

A constructor is a special method that has the same name as the class. It also does not have a return data type.
