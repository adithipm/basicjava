Here are my seventh session notes:

Syntax makes it easy to correct complication errors and concentrate on logical programming. The syntaxes we have learned so far are: if (followed by () and then {}), condition (true/false or yes/no), if else if, for (repition ( ; ; ){}), custom datatype (class yourdatatype), and using custom datatype (datatype variablename = new variable).

The techical term for creation or own datatype in java is class and for variable it is object or instance. Creating a class is like a template, cookie cutter, recipie, or blueprint.

An actions are verbs and classes are nouns. You use void and int to make the program do the action. Actions are also called methods and functions. They start with lowercase.
