Here are my fifteenth session notes:

Constructor overloading:
Constructor is a method with the same name as the class. So method overloading will work for constructors too.

A constructor is called a constructor because it is only used while creating an object.

Defining a method is different than calling a method. When you are defining a method, you include the name, inputs, outputs, and instructions. When the program is using the method and following the instructions, it is calling the method.

To not allow methods to be called in the Application class, use the work private before the method.
