Here are my ninth session notes:

Class: A template, blueprint, cookie cutter, recipe, and your custom data type. It contains fields and methods and methods can access fields. The class always has to be a singular noun.

Object: Varible and instance. You are creating a variable for your class.

Fields: These are the properties in the class. Once you define the variable it will become a field.

Methods: These are actions or verbs.

The connection between fields and methods are that methods can access fields from the same class. Fields are called instance variables.

Boolean: A datatype that stores yes or no.

Encapsulation: Putting related fields and methods in the same class. The second part is hiding the details. You can hide it by putting private in front of the method.
