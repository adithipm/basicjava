Here are my eighth session notes:

Class: technical term for datatype.
Object: technical term for variable.
Fields: technical term for class properties.
Methods: technical term for actions (verbs).

Methods in a class have access to the fields and can use them by calling it in the program. The fields are called object variables.

Boolean is a data type that is used when the data value can only take yes or no.
