Here are my sixth session notes:

To declare a variable you have to type it in the format: datatype variablename = valueofthevariable. The data types provided by Java are int and String. The data type int is only used for numbers and String is used for words.

To create your own data types you can use the basic ones. The syntax to create your own data type is: class yourowndatatypename {}. In this you can define your data type. For example: int weight; or String name;. To use your data type you put your data type and the variable name. For example Person person1;. To assign the variable value it is slghtly different. You have to use Person person1 = new Person (). Then you can assign different values to the parts of your data type. To do that type the variable.variablename = value. For example person1.age = 12. To print the variable value you use: System.out.println(person1.name + "age is" + person1.age);. The data type (class) should always be a singular noun.
